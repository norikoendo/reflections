remote = remote repository. Stuff that's on your hard drive is local. Stuff that's on GitHub's server is remote. origin = the default name of the remote repository on GitHub corresponding to the repo you're currently in on your machine. master = the default name of the initial branch of a repository. So, "origin master" is the default branch of your repository on GitHub.
